## Add recommendation CNN
<br>
This project aims to help companies improve ad efficiency by matching their advertisements to website content using a convolutional neural network model to classify images and choose the closest to reflect what is on each webpage.

This directory has a few jupyter notebooks and presentation that shows results and findings of the analysis: <br>
<br>
- 1_Scraping_images.ipynb - code that I used for scraping images from shopstyle website, <br>
- 2_Data_split_dir.ipynb - code for splitting images between folders for train and test sets for the analysis, <br>
- 3_Model.ipynb - code for building a model, <br>
- 3_Predictions.ipynb - code for transforming data set into set of vectors, <br> 
- 3_Recommendations.ipynb - code for building a recommendation system.<br><br>
